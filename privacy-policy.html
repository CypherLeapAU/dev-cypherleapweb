Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Tracking pixels are tiny, invisible images (typically the size of one pixel) embedded in web pages or emails. Cookies and tracking pixels, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information.

If and when you choose to provide our online website with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie or collected by tracking pixels. Unlike cookies, tracking pixels do not store any information on your device, but instead send information to our servers when the pixel is loaded.
